# Train-Scheduler
Objective: create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. 

Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. 

This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

#I made my trains appear based off of their frequency 
#I had to use variables in multiple different spots to have them appear and log - hopefully this was as necessary as I thought it was and not duplicate content
