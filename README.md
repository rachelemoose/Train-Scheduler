# Train-Scheduler
Objective: create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. 

Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. 

This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

#I made my trains appear based off of their frequency, the instructions were a little ambiguous so I hope this was correct.
When a user puts in a train, it calcualates when the next train will show up based off of the frequency of the train. 
I had to use variables in multiple different spots to have them appear and log - hopefully this was as necessary as I thought it was and not duplicate content
